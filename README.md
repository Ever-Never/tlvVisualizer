# tlvVisualizer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andreasWallner/tlvVisualizer.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/andreasWallner/tlvVisualizer)

A simple simple Eclipse plugin developed more to get into Eclipse stuff than anything
else.

Currently allows one to parse TLV (tag-length-value) data, and displays some additional
information based on the tag types defined by EMVco.

# Todo
 - fix TODOs in code...
 - TLVViewer: allow to pin root TLV
 - TLVViewer: combobox to select ID by name
 - TLVViewer: verify and show incorrect tree (subelements not allowed in hierarchy)
 - TLVViewer: don't change tree visibility on e.g. setTlvString if not necessary 
 - extension point for decoder
 - ...
